# ANNs From Scratch 
## A way to learn how Artificial Neural Networks are implemented in C++, and Python as well as how hyperparameters work within ANNs and how to modify them.
### A Midterms output for CCS 238: Programming Language Subject.

### Description Of The Problem
As a computer science student that majors in artificial intelligence. One of the most tackled topic 
within our course is artificial neural networks. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) is an essential 
sub-topic within our course as it serves as a foundation for many machine learning and AI tasks. 
However, due to many constraints within the education system ANNs tend to be hastily thought resulting 
to lesser knowledge about it. Especially when it comes to the different hyperparameters that make 
up ANNs and how to efficiently use and structure them.

### Project Overview
This project aims to build artificial neural networks (ANNs) from scratch in both C++ and Python, 
focusing on modifying and experimenting with hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and 
number of layers. By creating a customizable framework in both languages, users can delve into the 
mechanics of ANNs and observe how changes in hyperparameters impact performance, enabling a deeper 
understanding of their ultimate effects on model accuracy and training efficiency.
